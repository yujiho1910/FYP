# Preparation

- understand the wiki $\text{OA}(N, k, v, t)$ and the link to our $\text{OA}(m,n)$
- explain the construction of Hadamard matrices and the link to orthogonal arrays
- Read the chapter 6.3-6.7 of douglas book and explain the theorem

## Things to present

- Hamamard matrices
  - found out that it produces OAs of factor level = 2, aka $n=2$ only, not very useful
- 6.1 of book
  - showcases a quasigroup construction of latin square of size $n$, where $n$ is odd
  - If MOLS construction is just to find more latin squares, this quasigroup construction could be a different way of construction

## Things found out

- affine plane needs understanding [link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyCzd9uXkRc)
