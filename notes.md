# MH4900 Final Year Project

## Project Summary

The project will investigate properties of various constructions of Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS). In particular, it is well-known that MOLS correspond to certain 2-class association schemes. The project will investigation how MOLS can be switched to obtain more general coherent configurations.

## Current things to do

- Understand srg(n, k, λ, μ) and its relation to MOLS
- Understand Coherent Ranks
- Understand the clique graph of the SRG and see if it can be switched and see its relation to coherent ranks

### Being worked on

- Reading the paper the professor sent me
- Read up on the construction of MOLS [link](https://libstore.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/892/535/RUG01-001892535_2012_0001_AC.pdf)
